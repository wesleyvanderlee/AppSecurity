# AppSecurity

This repository provides and concludes all information and documents regarding my final year thesis of the MSC Computer Science at the Delft University of Technology.

*Although the importance of mobile applications grows every day, recent vulnerability reports argue the application's deficiency to meet modern security standards. Testing strategies alleviate the problem by identifying security violations in software implementations. This paper proposes a novel testing methodology that applies state machine learning of mobile Android applications in combination with algorithms that discover attack paths in the learned state machine. The presence of an attack path evidences the existence of a vulnerability in the mobile application. We apply our methods to real-life apps and show that the novel methodology is capable of identifying vulnerabilities.*
